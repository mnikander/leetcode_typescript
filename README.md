# Learning TypeScript

A collection of leetcode solutions in TypeScript.
These are mostly ported from my corresponding JavaScript repository.
The emphasis is NOT on efficient solutions, but on learning the basics of TypeScript.

## Getting started

Install system dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm
npm install typescript
```

Clone, build, and run:
```bash
git clone ...  # this repo
cd leetcode_typescript
npx tsc hello_world.ts    # compile the hello world example
node build/hello_world.js # run the hello world example
```
